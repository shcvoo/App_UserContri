Support for original sound	This is a great app for meetings and human voice. Unfortunately, it falls short in delivering a good live musical instrument sound for music lessons - especially for string instruments like the violin, cello and acoustic guitar (even when optimized for original sound, disabled intermittent and persistent background noise, etc...).   If ZOOM were to solve this issue and improve the sound to Hi-Fi for musicians, it would truly be the best conference app and it would attract lots of folks interested in virtual music lessons.  Also, truly great to share files, screen and video, but I wish there would be an option to choose a chat group during the conference instead of just one person or everyone.   This app has great potential!	相关

It’s an essential part of my job at this point, and as more of my work shifts to the iPad over time, I’m glad to have it present in that environment. However, the app seems to be lagging behind in some key respects: it doesn’t support modern iPad screen sizes/resolutions, it doesn’t support split view or slide over for multi-tasking, and when you switch to another app your own camera feed is cut off completely. If these issues could be resolved, I’d be ecstatic!  Please continue to invest in this app on iPad.	相关

Dark mode support	I have been a loyal Zoom user for 2 years. I have always loved how easy it is to use for novices. My appreciation for Zoom has quadrupled over the past two weeks. With the physical isolation associated with CoVid-19, Zoom has become essential as a work tool and as a way to connect family and friends. The whole world is using and relying on Zoom to deliver flawlessly, every day. Thank you for delivering on your promise. You are saving lives and contributing to the productivity of America during this very difficult time.  Thank you!	无关

Apple CarPlay support	I use this app all the time to take conference calls at home and the office. I often need to take these calls from the car as well. Zoom has a nice “safe driving mode” feature that lets you “tap to talk” if you dock your phone while you drive. I recently got a new car with CarPlay, and was surprised that the Zoom app icon in CarPlay doesn’t work the same way. Instead, when you launch Zoom from the dash, it launches a voice prompt asking who you want to call. It’s a worthless feature. I would much rather see a list of scheduled meetings. Once a meeting is launched, it should work just like the “safe driving mode” on the phone and let you mute, hang up, etc.	相关

Support keyboard shortcuts during a meeting for iPads with an external keyboard connected	It’s a really nice app for zoom on iPad. But when you want to do a little bit more it’s not the best. My 2 major problems.  1. Doesn’t have split view. I do need to see other files or take notes, or connect to my remote desktop while on a call... and the only option to mute unmute or see the attendees is to have this app full screen... it’s zoom app or nothing.  this is not a pro feature...  2. I have to use my BT phones wired while on a call, otherwise it freaks out the BT keyboard. This might be an Apple issue, but a growing company like Zoom might have something to say to Apple.   Bonus: Any way you can take control over the play/pause button to use it as mute/unmute?  Otherwise, a great and stable app.	相关
