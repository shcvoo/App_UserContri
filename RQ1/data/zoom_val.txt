相关	The user interface is designed so bad that it takes multiple clicks to call a contact. The app crashes frequently. The audio and video quality is awful. Overall, the app is not even worth installing. Google meet or houseparty are much better and reliable apps depending on your usage.

相关	I’ve already submitted a help request but haven’t heard back. 'frowning_face_selector' I would rate this much higher if this can get cleared up. First, I accidentally put a co-teacher’s number down and she responded (we both thought I was adding her as a contact— trying to set up distance learning!) but it gave ME all her phone contacts! I cannot unconnect her phone number or contacts. THIS SHOULD BE AN OPTION!!!! When I try to connect contacts (now that I know what that means 'woman_facepalming_light_skin_tone') it WON’T send a code within the 60 second timeout. In fact, the first code came in over an hour after requesting it. I know there is a big demand right now, but this is very frustrating!

相关	I really like the zoom app. Although I don’t use zoom for class I use it to CHAT with my friends. I think it’s very easy to use and has high security (e.g: needs password and passcode). One thing I really like is that there is a suspend everything feature just like a school lockdown. It mutes and turns off camera for everyone, locks the meeting and all that. I also like how there is a chat, way more convenient for mute people. So far I think zoom is a good app and I think everyone should download it to talk with your friends, class and your family. 10/10!
相关	Delayed video, and
相关	I think Zoom is a great app for you to reconnect with your friends during the Covid-19.I do have a problem with it, though. It cuts me and other people off. I have had to join the same call 4 times to hear what my friend is saying. Overall great app just a little connection problem.
无关	Zoom has served my colleagues and me so well for a few years while we develop projects and share research, but now — while the world struggles during the Coronavirus pandemic — it is a tool for teachers to reach students and home and for families to have group discussions. Thank you for this service. It’s helping us all stay in communication and feel less isolated.
相关	Zoom has helped me a lot when it comes to school. Zoom helps teachers to speak to their students and help them learn without being in close quarters. There is one problem though. Zoom should have more security. When I was attending my class, a random person named He Man came into the Zoom and started typing bad things into the chat and blasting inappropriate music. One other thing I think they should change in Zoom is the ability to write when a person is screen sharing. Anyone can write on what the teacher is reading to the class and that doesn’t seem to be able to be toggled by the teacher.  So, all in all Zoom is helpful, but could be with a few security improvements.
相关	It lags way to much I’m a student and it crashes and glitches all the time

相关	This app is pretty cool but I don’t really like apps that uses personal information but also can use some adds (not ads) here are some requests:  More screen emoji in case if your mute and your new and doesn’t know to to log out and rejoin.  Please get rid of the chat on the left head side when a meeting is on it distracted me and my family in a school meeting  A lot of glitches can be fix on a school meeting a couldn’t  hear a teacher that when and their face icon freeze and starts working again  I think there is a name icon on the bottom right on your face icon and before the meeting starts you have to type it in I think please make the type icon “name” or something like that  But otherwise it is good! I mean REAL GOOD
相关	Amazing program! This is perfect for online school and school wouldn’t be able to continue with zoom. There are so many cool features like sharing your screen, raising your hand, being able to mute, unmute, and turn cameras on and off, and making sure students are engaged in class , as you can record there screen throughout the class. 5 out of 5 stars.
相关	All of a sudden this week I can’t unmute some of my meeting participants and my kids’ teachers can’t unmute them.  This was not happening last week, with all of the same users on all of the same devices. Is there a bug in the newest version of the app?? Zoom please fix!
相关	I don’t know how to take off basic mode
相关	Zoom has been a great tool to use for this year’s events, and normally I would give it five stars. But, there is one thing that is really annoying - on mobile, you cannot turn the volume all the way down. In class when my teacher requires us to join our Zoom, there is this terrible echoing of their voice and any other noise that happens in the classroom. The only way to get it to stop is to put my headphones in and listen to it myself, which makes listening to the teacher almost impossible. I was hoping that the devs can make a small change and allow the volume on the mobile app to be completely turned off. Thank you for reading!
无关	I use this app every other week, sometimes weekly to video chat with my therapist when I can&，39;t make the two hour trip to see him.

相关	This is a great app for meetings and human voice. Unfortunately, it falls short in delivering a good live musical instrument sound for music lessons - especially for string instruments like the violin, cello and acoustic guitar (even when optimized for original sound, disabled intermittent and persistent background noise, etc...).   If ZOOM were to solve this issue and improve the sound to Hi-Fi for musicians, it would truly be the best conference app and it would attract lots of folks interested in virtual music lessons.  Also, truly great to share files, screen and video, but I wish there would be an option to choose a chat group during the conference instead of just one person or everyone.   This app has great potential!

相关	Why would Zoom remove the host’s Unmute All feature? I’ve had to use it EVERY time I’ve had a meeting because there’s always a need.

We use it 3-4 hours per day for spontaneous meetings, scheduled meetings, and eSeminars. The HD quality and audio are excellent and the interface is incredibly user friendly.  In addition, the ease of scheduling a Zoom meeting via Google calendar makes this a highly useful tool for collaboration.  I would highly recommend Zoom!

相关	This app is incapable of switching audio outputs. Switching from car audio to headset and the audio drops entirely. Have to force close and restart app. Headset to speaker, same deal.   Also breaks every time you switch networks. Go from LTE to WiFi and everything stops. Have to force close and restart app.   I can schedule meetings but not shown my scheduled meetings?!

相关	I really do not understand why the camera for Zoom cant stay on while I have another screen open. I mean seriously? This isnt a hardware or software problem, it is a developer problem. You must use only Zoom for the camera to work and if not, it disables the camera. Makes no sense imo.
相关	I use an online collaborative portal called team box and a bit ago they incorporated zoom into the platform suite.  I have started using zoom all the time to meet with clients.  In addition to talking face to face you are also able to share screens and annotate documents on your own computer.  It's amazing though I do admit I tend to host the meeting mostly on my PC rather than my ipad.  The possibilities are vast with this program.  I have even used it to help my aging mother with her computer.  Talking her through any computer problem is the most hellish thing in my life.  With zoom I just set up a meeting, tell her to give me control of her screen and I can fix the issue as if it is her computer that is in front of me.

This is a massive waste of time and inconvenience.

相关	This video meeting app works well enough. The virtual backgrounds are nice, and the microphones and videos usually work the way they’re supposed to. On an iPad, though, you have fewer options then on a computer. The main accessories that Zoom does not allow on an iPad are remote control, (you can move the mouse that appears on-screen, but you can’t do anything else, not click, not select, nothing), whiteboard, (it shows up and you get colors, but not nearly as many as you get on a computer. I would love it if you added a color wheel), and breakout rooms (You can go into them but they don’t show up in the menu). I always use my iPad for Zoom meetings, but I feel I am not getting the full expirence. Also, when you do Zoom online, you can have moving virtual backgrounds, but those don’t exist on the app. If you could change all this, this rating would go up to five stars faster then you can say “Zoom”. But for now, you get two.

I was the leader of the chat so I was suppose to be able to except people onto the chat but I didn’t get any Notification about who was joining and if I saw I would have declined it, but u was scary and I don’t want me family on there knowing that a hacker can pop up on my family out of nowhere while they are online doing what they need to do on there.

相关	It will not let me make a zoom or even join one
相关	It stole information of mine and keeps opening my camera at random times. This app is not safe and I don’t think it should be used, for online schooling or anything
相关	So I’m starting with low expectations on zoom the desktop version is way better but anyway started out with Me not being able to even put my real brith date to verify and it’s not letting me in to the app I’ve tried deleting it and it still doesn’t work. This needs to be fixed
无关	Zoom is the best and easiest web conference tool.  I see a lot of recent Haters who hate zoom because they don’t want to have Online School. Just shut up and stop it with the bad reviews.
无关	Disrespectful low life’s hacked our meeting with nude pictures , racial slurs, cursing. Just horrible
相关	Stop reminding me that this app doesn’t have access to the microphone or the camera. I know it doesn’t because I explicitly denied access to those  
无关	This application is constantly kicking me off. My account is being temporarily suspended on the weekly basis. Don’t recommend  
相关	It’s great being able to participate in a Zoom on my iPad.  It’s an essential part of my job at this point, and as more of my work shifts to the iPad over time, I’m glad to have it present in that environment. However, the app seems to be lagging behind in some key respects: it doesn’t support modern iPad screen sizes/resolutions, it doesn’t support split view or slide over for multi-tasking, and when you switch to another app your own camera feed is cut off completely. If these issues could be resolved, I’d be ecstatic!  Please continue to invest in this app on iPad.  
相关	It does not let me in to the meeting when I’m invited.....
无关	THERE IS NO PRIVACY AT ALL WHAT SO EVER. WORST APP TO HAVE FOR SCHOOLS.
相关	This is a great app, but I want to make a feature suggestion:  we use Zoom for our Sign Language meetings. Since we always turn the microphone OFF, it would be great if there was an option to DISABLE the “Audio is Off” reminder box that pops up EVERY TIME we are “Spotlighted”. It is extremely annoying. The person being spotlighted always has to lean in and tap Cancel, or sometimes they accidentally tap the wrong button and turn their sound on. It would be GREAT if we could keep that message from appearing when we are Spotlighted.   Thank you
无关	Chris Johnson is awesome!!
相关	I find the zoom is not very user friendly and is very limited with out getting into grate detail. I just want to cast my zoom meeting to my tv. You need a book to do this.
相关	Everytime I join a class, the mic is always on. I have the “Always mute my microphone” thing activated, but everytime I join a class meeting, it is on. Even one of my classmates got kicked out of class because he just joined and his mic was unmuted and said mean stuff to someone, but not to the class I’m guessing it’s to his siblings. And as I said his mic was unmuted because he just joined, please fix this!!! What if someone just joined and someone around him/her says something personal while the mic is unmuted?!?! You have to please fix this!!!
无关	Steals information without telling you about it and can sell information about you and share it online on Facebook
相关	Zoom drains IPhone 8plus battery . I have heard from my colleagues who use different versions of iPhone about this same issue. Please do something about it.

相关	I really like Zoom! It’s a great way to connect with family and teach classes from home! The only problem is when I’m trying to play music while teaching a fitness class… Zoom does not allow for both the music and my voice to reach participants clearly. Is there a way to rectify this problem? Staci B
相关	So when I go on the app and go into a Zoom call it always gets stuck and I can’t press the audio with the headphones it just gets stuck.Sometimes it works that is why I gave it a two but most of the time it does not work. I really don’t recommend this app. I’d rather use FaceTime that works really good.'thumbs_down_dark_skin_tone'
相关	I wish Zoom supported virtual background settings for iPad Air 2. And if you won’t support older iPads, at least include that info in your FAQs, Help, and video tutorials etc. I spent a lot of time trying to get it to work. It was only through a third party article I happened to stumble across that I found out that I had to have at least a 5th generation iPad in order to use the virtual background feature. Please, it would be nice if you could update the app and open this up to older iPad versions. Thank you!

无关	Periodt luv
相关	The video quality is not nearly as good as Duo, or even FaceTime, but if you need to use Zoom for work, I guess the app is good enough.  The only clunky piece is returning to a call after locking your phone. Waking your phone brings you to a call screen, but not the video. Unlocking the phone then sends the call to the background. You need to open the app again to get back to the video. I’m not sure if this is Apple’s fault or Zoom’s fault.  
无关	Me do school it is good zoom
无关	I tried all solutions out there. This one is my favorite! It works every time.
无关	Gets a bit choppy sometimes. I like school better.
相关	I got kicked out of the meeting and had trouble signing back in.
相关	This app hates my iPad. Mind you, it works perfect on my phone.....  
相关	Zoom is wonderful - I am involved in meetings with several organizations, and it has been a lifesaver during the pandemic.  There are a couple of extremely annoying features that drive me crazy.    First, the controls stay onscreen for such a brief time that when you’re working with a new user, they don’t have time to locate the icons for View, microphone, video before they disappear.  I finally have to tell them to KEEP a finger on an iPad until we get things located.  Second, controls are top &amp; bottom on a computer but on the side for iPad.  WHY?  Just to make it hard for one user to assist another?  Otherwise, the app is terrific &amp; I recommend it highly.
相关	The interface (especially with regards to user controls) is hard to navigate. It’s not intuitive, and I don’t want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to perform simple tasks… like changing my location, or deleting a recurring meeting (that I don’t even remember setting up). And, the help bot is worthless. Zoom has a lot of work to do on this app before it’ll have widespread use for anything other than prescheduled meetings. Otherwise, it’s pretty good.
无关	i saw a video where it show it can steal your data and turn on your camera whenever it decides. And it doesn&，39;t state that in the privacy policy'disappointed_face'
无关	Dude this is the app my school is using since we are in coronacation we have school through this app. This is by far the best experience i have ever had with school and its probably because of this app.
无关	Great now i have to do school work
相关	I’m trying to get help from support and I’m not able to get a customer support on line for help.
无关	.  
相关	Even though volume is low, Zoom overrides the volume and it pierces your ears when you join a meeting if you’re wearing headphones.  
无关	Do not load this software!  
相关	I can’t even sign up . I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing works.
无关	Thank you!!
相关	The microphone barley works- and Audio isn’t even good quality. The share screen is very glitchy and laggy.
相关	Can’t copy and paste the meeting ID from a calendar item into the meeting id field.
相关	Great service for meetings. Only reason I’m giving a 3 instead of a 5 is the difficulty in accessing billing info and changing/canceling service.
无关	This app steals data when ever they want for you device not only that but turns on your camera when ever they want. This app also shares your information onto Facebook AND doesn’t keep the private messages to themselves so teachers can see them
无关	My experience using Zoom is great!  So appreciated this device!
相关	I am very happy with the use of Zoom.  I think users need more instructions on how to mute and how close they should be to the camera, etc.  That is a user issue - not everyone knows what to do.  Otherwise a good experience.
相关	Best web, video and audio collaboration app out there.  I’ve tried everything and Zoom is the only one that just works seemlessly.  It even has a safe driving mode and integrates with our office conference rooms
无关	Been attending zoom conference calls for the last few months in this paid coaching group I’ve joined and it’s super annoying how many times things break up and there is this robotic delay thing and you can’t understand what the person is saying. Happens all the time.  
相关	I have a vendor using this app and every time I start it auto starts the camera. Horrible. This should ALWAY be for the user to decide.   Disabled camera access is settings and now every time I launch or switch back the app gives me a nag to give it camera access.   This is bad programming by the developers.  
相关	Zoom is a wildly popular conferencing app, because it has great video and audio quality.  The great conferencing ability is marred by a dreadful app. Joining a meeting is a painful slog of many clicks. Joining a recurring meeting is at least as hard as a one-off; zoom doesn’t remember anything from one time to the next. No integration with the password manager, so you must remember your password, and you’ll re-use the simple one you use for all the crap websites. Almost no configurability of how participants are displayed. For some inadequate reason, it always wants to launch through a web link, opening another useless tab, and adding a couple of useless clicks.  Great video, crap app.
无关	Stealin my info
相关	Downloaded this app for a very important court case I had to attend. Because of your settings I was unaware of I was dismissed from virtual waiting area because I had no audio to hear the Jude ask my name 2 times.   This mad me look bad in the eyes of the judge so I’m not pleased

相关	When I first downloaded Zoom I tried to sign up I did everything right but the it said that It was going to send me an email but it never did
相关	This app is very very glitchy. Seems to only work well with newest MacBooks with significant storage. Need to improve the connectivity/server issues ASAP. Also Zoom bombing is a serious concern we are overlooking.
相关	Net is fast.. Every app works... But zoom doesn&，39;t...it always keeps saying &，34;connecting&，34; pls fix it
无关	Very very  
相关	When ever I try to create a meeting and invite my friends I can’t! So please fixxx. And STOP SAYING I CANT SIGN UP AT THIS TIME!
相关	I’m teaching using Zoom and iPad for whiteboarding.  I  screen on my iPad using Zoom, but randomly, sometimes a few minutes after screen share, sometimes tens of minutes after, my iPad got disconnected from the Zoom hosted on my laptop with a frozen screen snapshot showed on laptop. I removed Zoom and reinstalled it with the hope that this issue would be gone. However, the same issue still persists, and that’s really annoying, as it wasted the precious time in my class teaching.
相关	Downloaded Zoom recently and wow! The mobile, tablet and desktop app is very easy to use and a breeze to navigate through. Once you\'re on a Zoom meeting, webinar or \"zoom room\" the QUALITY of video & audio is second to none. Love that it is software-based so my participants/audience can join in from their desktop, laptop, mobile device, tablet and even H.323/SIP room systems. It\'s all cloud based so my viewers can join worldwide! Lastly, the collaborated environment Zoom\'s application provides is essential to any business meeting since you are able to screen share seamlessly, share high quality video & audio, annotate, cloud record, local record and so much more! Great company with a solution that will truly be the frontrunner in this space!
无关	I would highly consider they can turn on cameras whenever they want to and steal data from apps, as Zoom is known to do that before
无关	Howdy! So, when I did it, it glitches a LOT but I love it 'smiling_face_with_heart-eyes' it is very complicated and you have enter a code. I use this for school and it is so 'smiling_face_with_sunglasses' 'folded_hands'
无关	Zoom has been vital to educators and students across the world during COVID-19.  We have been able to see, teach, listen, and communicate quickly and efficiently to better serve our families and community while social distancing. Thank you!
无关	watched someone forget to mute their mic and get into a screaming match with someone else in the room while having a completely straight face. Stay inside flatten the curve.
无关	Thank you so much for providing teachers a way to connect with each other &amp; our students. By giving us that necessary ability to meet face to face, real time is important &amp; necessary. You are number 2 on my gratitude list today after my family and friends. Thank you during our Remote Covid-19 Learning situation. I truly appreciate your app.
无关	No video available  
相关	It won’t even let me sign up because it says my birthday is ineligible.
无关	The quality is terrible
相关	I use Zoom to continue piano lessons during Covid19 isolation: once we figured out we need to “Use Original Sound” it has been great. Thanks SO MUCH for making this option available on iPad, iPhone etc.
无关	What a killer tool. Works extremely well and I rely on it for business. We're a paying customer. Best in its class.
无关	Works every time...
相关	I have online school and have a zoom meeting and I couldn’t hear anything  and the screens would be frozen and then speed up so it was confusing. It was really bad. It was really slow. I think you should fix it so I can actually hear my teacher next time
相关	Camera is turned on automatically and if you turn it off, you get a banner to turn it on and it does not let you see the presentation content.  This should be against privacy rules!
相关	I love using the Zoom app on my phone. Being able to communicate via the chat function when away from my office really helps and joining meetings is a breeze!
无关	This is better that FaceTime and zoom is a good app.
无关	'thumbs_up'
无关	Very easy to use.  Great quality audio &amp; video.
无关	horrible  
相关	The app is good, but there’s a bug that doesn’t allow me to share my screen. It worked before, and for some reason now it doesn’t.
相关	So enjoy our zoom visits!  But how can we prevent all starting to talk at the same time? 5 of us talk together weekly.  Frequently 2 or 3 start talking at the same time! Then we all go silent!  Then finally 1 starts alone'grinning_face'
相关	Could not reconnect to a meeting with that I was initially connected to using the link from my meeting host, but once the video picture went out, I tried to reconnect in the same manner using the link and it did not work!!! Then when I tried to use the ZOOM app it didn’t recognize the meeting ID repeatedly after several attempts! So I missed this meeting completely! Urg!!!'confounded_face'
无关	Whether for business or families in these times of “shelter in place”, I recommend highly using zoom.  Our BSF group has continued without missing a beat.  Our family “meets” in the evenings...not the same, of course but nearly so
相关	Over 21  it tells me I am not eligible to sign up.
相关	App for iPhone/iPad doesn’t allow me to search my contacts when setting up a meeting.
无关	Must I say more
相关	Needs more controls in IOS app on where to send the audio signal...only available if hosting the meeting and not consistent across devices, whether phones or iPads. For instance, if I connect an HDMI lightning port adapter to iPhone 8plus and host the meeting from it, I can select to send the audio to my TV or use internal speakers but if I host from the iPad, I am not able to control where to send the audio signal...and worse yet, if I join a meeting hosted from another device, the audio will never go to the TV speakers from either the iPhone or the iPad. When not using Zoom, either device will always send audio to the TV so it’s not the devices, the HDMI cable, or lightning port adapter...Zoom’s tech support is non-existent...have called several times and their answering service says someone will call me soon...still hasn’t happened weeks later.
相关	So since we are in quarintine ive been using zoom a lot,but sometimes my friends are claiming that there is a button to change your backround and I don’t know if its on iPads because im using one.Please let me know about this because my backround usally is very messy!
无关	I like this app because you can text or call your friends
无关	Excellent meeting tool
相关	I opened a free account and want to upgrade. Followed instructions on how to use on YouTube. Went to settings, but could not open my account
无关	No directions as to how this is used. I have missed many meetings due to this.

无关	Hi
相关	I don’t know if you all know this but this app is getting viewed by the FBI for a reason we can all get 1.They share your data with Facebook 2.They can view the tabs on YOUR COMPUTER 3.You can get your identity stolen from this app 4.They have the ability to turn on your camera when they want 5.FILLED WITH PERVERTS WHO CAN GO IN YOUR CHAT JUST GUESSING THE PASSWORD.One day I was just chilling with my friends and this random person goes in the chat reminder we are 11 his words are “You ladies are very sexy maybe we can meet somewhere” This terrified us this man sounded like he has done this to other people which is sad. I get it we use this for school but isn’t there other ways that we can do online school? One thing I’m glad about is this app can get taken down by the FBI. I don’t know about you but I don’t want to get my identity stolen by a random person for example imagine you have your credit card information in one of your tabs zoom can easily check that with out YOUR PERMISSION and steal money from you. Say you have your address some where in a different tab zoom can easily see that. Say you want privacy you turn off your camera nope zoom won’t let that they have the ability to turn it back on again without YOUR PERMISSION. It’s just disgusting to know that zoom has the ability to do this and lets perverts in this app.

相关	I can’t seem to log in and get into a meet what is SSO too I can’t hear the audio too
无关	VERY bad
相关	I’m enjoying a variety of Zoom meetings. My one difficulty is around signing in: as a disorganized person, finding ID numbers and Passwords can sometimes be awkward and leave me scrambling. I would sure appreciate a simplified method for getting into the meetings. I appreciate Zoom!
相关	It won’t let me join any meetings when I put I. The right codes and it really upsets me
相关	I can’t sign up for it. It’s saying invalid when I am 21 years of age.
相关	Takes really long to type entire meeting ID, user ID, and once I’m in the meeting it still prevents me from hearing by saying “x number of members in the call. This meeting is being recorded” by then I’ve missed something.   Also it unmutes me as soon as I switch to phone audio, very dangerous.  EDIT: WOW!  I tried to enter my passcode while in the meeting and EVERYONE could hear my phone dials. Extremely inappropriate, lowered from two stars to one because of this.
相关	The audio and video quality can vary significantly. Audio is choppy. Video often freezes. Much can be improved.
无关	Loving this app for meetings with my social groups !
相关	Downloaded the app. When I try to sign up it asks for my birthday.  Believe me I’m well over 18 if that’s their age limit.  But it tells me I’m not eligible to sign up.
无关	this app it’s awesome!
相关	Mobile app on iPad and iPhone doesn’t allow you to put attendees in breakout rooms. Completely useless for teaching if you’re on an iPad Pro.
无关	Best
相关	This app is really bad my audio is so bad on the app it sounds like 1 billion people talking at once I keep on changing my volume and it’s the same thing and it’s not my device because my audio is on other apps except for this one
相关	It would be better if the kids cameras will stay on even when they get out of a app. And it would also be better if us teachers had control of just unmuting and starting the students cameras. Overall it was a 4 out of 5 but a wonderful app.
无关	I do not recommend this application . Their privacy practices are nightmares. Zero protection or care of consumer data or privacy.
相关	To switch from a break out room to another as a host you must be on a desktop computer, which is very inconvenient when you are calling in to multiple meetings or ALL day trainings. It’s should be a little more tech friendly given its popularity!
相关	Wish I never downloaded it. Lag is supream awful and I can’t ever log in. Plus it kicks you out of your meanings.
相关	Great product in many ways, but their customer service is as bad as it gets. If you file a inquiry, it could take 2 to 3 months before you get a response.
相关	Everyone on the same link can log on for court. Had all the login info confirmed and it still tells me wrong passcode for the meeting. Not pleased to find this bug hasn’t been fixed.
无关	Does not work and hard to use
无关	Mostly I’ve been skeptical on using these, but due to coronavirus I have to- and honestly, I love the app!  Very good quality audio, though occasionally cuts a bit.  Excellent video quality!
相关	The iOS version of Zoom has some serious and inexplainable limitations over the desktop version. First, only four video feeds can be seen at once. Given that the processors in all modern iPhones are significantly more capable than the processors in most modern Macs, I don’t see the reason for this. Other video chatting apps do not have this limitation. It makes Zoom on iOS almost unusable in large meetings. Second, unlike on the computer, I cannot choose the sound input and output, for example input via the iPhone microphone but output via headphones. I hope these issues will be fixed soon.

相关	I love this app because since I have siblings I can do my school on my phone for my school meeting but every time I try to login with my school account and I click join meeting at the top after you log in it kicks you out of your account and then you have to sign in again and it takes so long that sometimes I miss school
相关	It has terrible glitches sometimes that don’t allow me to sign in. But other then that it’s amazing.
无关	This app steals our information from any open apps or tabs(if you use a computer) and also has access to turn on our cameras even if we are not using the app. The app takes data from your device and shares it with Facebook, never use this app it is terrible.

相关	Seems the video only works in portrait mode.  Maybe I’m just too old to figure it out. Turning my phone to landscape mode causes my visual to turn sideways for others.

I can’t deal with the audio because it keeps on crashing and when I am in a meeting and about 15 minutes into it I can’t hear anyone.Again I like this app but please fix it, thank you.

相关	It’s a really nice app for zoom on iPad. But when you want to do a little bit more it’s not the best. My 2 major problems.  1. Doesn’t have split view. I do need to see other files or take notes, or connect to my remote desktop while on a call... and the only option to mute unmute or see the attendees is to have this app full screen... it’s zoom app or nothing.  this is not a pro feature...  2. I have to use my BT phones wired while on a call, otherwise it freaks out the BT keyboard. This might be an Apple issue, but a growing company like Zoom might have something to say to Apple.   Bonus: Any way you can take control over the play/pause button to use it as mute/unmute?  Otherwise, a great and stable app.

相关	I’m using zoom for online school and it’s good but the audio is not the best. Could you have the audio be fixed? That’s my only complaint, otherwise it’s awesome! 'grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes'
相关	I use this almost daily for work and it’s definitely the best in its class for stability and features. Minor complaints are around UI bits - I swear the floating command bar during screen share is sentient and manages to figure out how to move over and obscure the one thing I need underneath. Would like more control over floating vs. fixed palettes but these are easy to deal with.
相关	The audio is completely fine when chatting with near by users, but  I can not hear people from distance.

Zoom has helped me talk to my friends that I am not near though. It also helped me with my classes and it’s not that bad.

相关	Zoom makes me mad . It will let you be on the zoom for 37 minutes then give you a 10 minute warning and it jus ends after . I don’t like how it end like that .
无关	I have been around and teied virtually most of the available apps for multi-video conferencing. In the past month I have used Zoom to great satisfaction and more recently with the Stay at Home rules, I increased dramatically my day to day use of the app. Easy to use, friendly, conplete, great sound and video quality. What else to expect! Kudos from a very satisfied user!!!
相关	Apparently there was a new update 19 hours ago. I had no trouble w Zoom on iPad yesterday and today it freezes and doesn’t allow me to join a meeting or even log in. I uninstalled and reinstalled a few times to no avail. Desktop zoom is still working and no other problems w my iPad. Heeeellllpppp

无关	Great!!!
无关	I use this app for online school, but now that I&，39;ve heard that they use whatever window you have open on your laptop, I don&，39;t think this will happen again.
相关	while some students are trying to get it to 1 star, i believe that zoom should have 5. its a great way for me to talk to my friends while facetime or other apps like it may be lacking. the only thing i don’t like is that the only 2 ways that you can invite someone is by email or sending them a call notification (it’s hard to find the link to text) overall, it’s a good app and it’s gotten me through quarentine
相关	I have classes through zoom on my iPad and recently I have a problem that I can&，39;t see the teacher.  It&，39;s showing only his sharing screen. Could you please fix this bag? I would really appreciate it.
相关	The app works great on the iPad Pro.  The problem I have is it seems to lock up nearly every time I try to open after it was idle for several days. I have to delete and reinstall the app, then it works fine again.  Fortunately, it’s a small app and installs quickly.
相关	During a 30 min zoom this will happen twice: everybody on the call on my screen will freeze for about 30 seconds with no audio. I also liked the fact that they had a setting where you could make yourself look prettier. Yes, it does make your skin look softer and smoother but I think there should be different levels or stages of how much it affects your appearance. It would be really nice to not have to put a lot of make up on for a 15 min call. You would just press one button instead of spending 30 mins trying to look nice. Otherwise, it is a very nice app.
相关	Can’t run or update on Mac OS X. On iPad has limited functionality compared to other users on full pc platforms. Example , the gallery view shows maximum of 9 users on iPad but can show 15 users on other platforms.  It won’t let me change my screen name after installation time. Some people want to show last name for some meetings and sometimes not for other meetings
相关	I like the app. It seems pretty easy to navigate but I’m having the hardest time setting up my off camera photo.

相关	I’ve been using Zoom on my iPad for 6 months now and with the latest update, Zoom seems to greatly reduce the volume of my 3rd party audio when trying to screen share from the iPad. Some apps are muted, others AppleMusic) have no audio output at all. My participants and I cannot hear the audio.
相关	I get a text from Zoom that says, “Enter this code in Zoom to verify your phone number.” Really? Just where am I supposed to enter this? Under Settings? There’s nothing in there for this, in fact my phone number is nowhere in Settings. Nor is there any other place in any other selectable option in the Zoom app. So now what? I won’t be able to use Zoom because you simpletons can’t give clear instructions? God I hate poorly written instructions.
相关	I couldn’t get the email to signup. Super frustrating!  
无关	I feel that Zoom deserves a five star rating because it is giving me and my friends to access and call each other without knowing everyone’s phone numbers. Especially because of the Coronavirus.

相关	Nothing on the zoom blog answers this but it’s hard to use it in meetings with those heat warnings.
无关	this is happening because they are now run by Facebook and Facebook can take any data from this app if they want. They can sell it, delete it, and just take it from you! This is not good and very much an invasion of mine and your privacy  
相关	Sometimes when I join it has a loading icon in the middle and I can’t do anything, they only way to reboot it is to turn off the device completely! Sometimes in call I get kicked for no reason and have to rejojn!
相关	Maybe make a private GROUP chat for talking only to select people?
相关	Quick and easy way to communicate and meet... Audio breaks up sometimes, but it’s most lively operator error!
相关	We were receiving numerous interruptions. Images from Nazi propaganda materials. Closed with minions playing the drums. Sad commentary. Tells the sign of times on even zoom.
无关	Zoom is a really good app. I had a meeting with majority of my associates and I was so surprised that Zoom was able to handle everyone that joined the virtual meeting. There were over 20 people who joined the meeting. So, zoom is a really good app. No lags. No disconnections. The sound quality was okay at times but other than that, The video quality is great. No complaints from either of us. Zoom gave us the opportunity to successfully do virtual meetings with many people, without setbacks and that, is why you developers deserve more than 5 stars.
相关	Sometimes we have a little feedback if I’m sitting to close to someone else who is the same meeting, but one of us turns the mic off and we’re good to go! Love this app!

相关	This app is great in general. However when I call in with the phone link for the meeting there is no way to prevent myself from being unmuted at any time by the host. This can lead to some awkward situations to say the least. It also drops the call quite often with 4 bars of LTE.  May 2, 2020 update: The app still lets the host unmute phone tie-in callers without their permission'thumbs_down'  Aug 1, 2020 update: Still lets the host unmute callers without their permission.

相关	Hi, there are a few issues I would like to address about the app “Zoom”. First, I like the new update, but Zoom Is laggy and glitchy on the iPad. I have to constantly turn my WiFi on and off for it to work. Secondly, I can&，39;t get into a Breakout room without it saying “check your internet”. I like the app and it’s a great tool to use for socializing therefore I’m giving it 4/5 stars, but may you please fix these small issues. Please and Thank you. &lt;3
无关	Fue una experiencia muy buena. Todavía me falta relacionarme más con la aplicación. Sería recomendable que cuando se de un servicio religioso aparezcan tres fotos principales es decir, la ministro o sacerdote etc., el que lee la palabra diaria o amplia las escrituras de la biblia, y el que canta o toca el piano. Además debe haber un icono para depositar las ofrendas. Esto solamente son ideas 'light_bulb' para mejorar.  ¡Adelante siempre! 'thumbs_up'

相关	I have iPhone 6 and it’s only a couple years old. I followed directions for Zoom. I’ve deleted it 3 times and put it back on my phone and I can enter meetings and see and hear everyone but they can’t see me. The red mute and movie camera at the bottom will not allow me to turn them on. So how would you rate the zoom app if it didn’t work correctly on your phone?
相关	Just Have to say it’s how we connect now. I like the platform it’s easy to use not sure how I will like the password and waiting room changes but we have to do what we have to do if we want to see people.

相关	High marks for the ease of accessing my zoom meeting today.  My only problem, today, was the volume... my group could hear me but I could barely hear them.  After leaving the meeting,  I turned off my phone (rebooting it).  I rejoined my zoom meeting, successfully.  Volume was clear! Maybe my “sound trouble” was my phone... not the zoom app?

相关	The app only shows you meetings scheduled for today. One of my coworkers accidentally scheduled today’s meeting for yesterday, so I couldn’t join the meeting through the app. I ended up joining the call five minutes late... very embarrassing because I was supposed to lead the call. Well, I lost that opportunity because the app doesn’t give access to join meetings that are scheduled for another day.  
无关	A major joy has been a regular weekly breakfast with my group of mostly Sunday School friends which began years ago. We are now in the most vulnerable age group.  Zoom has meant that we can still “meet” &amp; get to see &amp; hear— and not be isolated (i. e. lonely).  We love it!  Thank you, Zoom!
无关	Zoom works very well, and it is easy to use. However, Zoom developers went too far in their efforts to make it easy when they decided to install a server on Mac computers, without notifying users. (This made those Macs vulnerable to hacking.)  Apple has now resolved that problem by automatically uninstalling the Zoom server.
无关	Zoom has become an important connection for many people in recovery. Zoom is literally saving lives. Sadly Zoom wants to start charging for their service. Many people have lost their jobs and livelihood. For people in early recovery, the monetary loss coupled with the stressors that our new reality has become make staying sober extremely difficult. And to drink is to die. But because Zoom offers a vehicle where the addict/alcoholic can go to meetings, and stay connected, Zoom provides a glimmer of light. A safe spot, a reprieve. I am so grateful to Zoom for helping our community.

相关	I’m not a fan of Zoom because it is cluttered and not intuitive. From a participant’s perspective, GoToMeeting is beautifully simple, clean and much easier to use. I’m not a computer person, so, when I look at Zoom’s screen it looks cluttered and it makes me work to understand it. I don’t have time to navigate the technology and just want immediate access to content.

相关	Zoom is simply ok. It works for the most part but sometimes I get stuck on the connecting screen for minutes before it connects and I try to check my WiFi but it is always strong. Recently I was kicked out of a meeting and I couldn’t join in again. These are just a few things that maybe can be worked out. Something else that I noticed is that on zoom if two people are talking you can’t hear any of them. Maybe zoom needs to upgrade in terms of audio.

相关	Zoom is a very useful means of having group chats to communicate with friends, family members and colleagues. However, sometimes sound quality is not so good.
无关	Zoom you must stop leaking personal information. We are dealing with a pandemic and the fact that your taking advantage of this situation and selling people’s email and pictures is disgusting. Especially when so many people have to use it for school now. Not a trusted app incredibly sad and disappointing.
无关	The CEO of Zoom allowed free and unrestricted access to Zoom to educators during this crisis and it has kept everyone afloat. Thank you.
无关	During the social distancing it helps keep in touch with people and with teachers best thing to have right now!'smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes'
相关	The workshop keep going in and out.Missed parts of information.  
无关	Good app
相关	I cannot set a virtual background on the device I am using, but on another device I can. They both have the newest update, so I don’t know what to do.
相关	I cannot get connected! This has been going on for 3 weeks. When it asks me to enter nickname, itALWAYS says that it’s taken
相关	I was on a friend get together Zoom call as soon as I downloaded the app and I found it being pretty awesome!!  There is this whiteboard effect where everyone can draw/write at the same time.  We shared thoughts, drawings, and funny sketches with this, the zoom app is mainly purposed to bring workers in companies back together to discuss matters, but I found it a pleasant group chat with my friends.  Everyone says people sometimes judges things by first impressions and right now, I like this app- but that may change (my review might change) but I love it so far.   I recommend this app for people in businesses and people who just want to hang with their friends!  :-D - a Zoom user with an odd name : “song rater”.  Very odd name:-D  :-D If you have survived my long review, and read through my thoughts and feelings toward this app, I appreciate your patience, thank you for reading
无关	Thank you for giving this to schools. You are the kind of person who makes society work.
相关	It’s ok but I think they can make a few changes like on my phone I can’t like personalize my camera and audio like computers can. Overall it’s pretty nice to make big meetings with your friends or work meetings. I think it’s a decent app.
相关	WHY can’t I chat in IMs AND be on a meeting at the same time? It drives me nuts.  Also, if I read a message and mark it as unread, then I review the chats on my computer, the message doesn’t appear as unread there, only on my phone.   Everything else is meh.  
无关	can’t hear or see anyone
无关	I can&，39;t believe how easy it is use. It is an amazing tool to use during this isolation. (Shelter in place order) I highly recommend to everyone
相关	I like zoom and have participated in many meetings. The biggest issue I have is when a session is started and the host has muted the participants and someone joins after the fact, the host settings do not apply to the new participants. In large meetings, late comers may have dogs barking, children crying, etc. which is a complete interruption.
相关	The only problem is the fact that the red microphone icon seems to stay on I tried deleting and then installing but nothing seems to work still it is a great app
无关	This app is super Gucci and I 'red_heart_selector' it. It is very useful.
无关	I have to use this app for school or else i’ll fail all my classes, but i wouldn&，39;t have a problem if they didn&，39;t sell or give away information about its users. The chat function could use improvements too.
无关	Well it is pretty good app it glitches a lot
无关	This app is possibly the worst I have reviewed. This is supposed to be a break from school and now my teachers are making me see their face. No.
相关	I have an iPhone 8 and an X and have tried to use this app on the go for calls and chat and the performance makes it unusable. Very slow response time trying to do anything in the app. Desktop version is great though.  
无关	You have been a life saver to education. No lag or connection problems. Thanks.
相关	I can’t leave this call. None if the buttons work. If I leave the app and re-open it it just takes me back to the call. I WAS TRYING TO CALL MY FRIEND BUT NOW ZOOM IS JUST ANNOYING UGH!!!
无关	good
相关	Zoom freezes and even removes me from meetings for no reason. This is completely unreliable and even does it on my laptop.
无关	For the boys For the boys For the boys
相关	Was in the meeting. Video and acoustics working when another program came up on the right on my machine. I could NOT get rid of it! It knocked out my Zoom picture. I could see the other folks but they could not see me. They COULD hear me. I turned the machine off and back on, but still had the problem. VERY frustrating!  In another weekly meeting I get through putting the number for the meeting in, and then it asks for a password. I do not HAVE the password except for a very long number and letter combo (about 15 characters). Then it would not accept it. The meeting organizer sent me a five or six letter password so I could get in late. . . Why does that one show up with her invite?
相关	I am using the zoom phone feature and the phone icon does not show upon the app sometimes. It works sometimes. When not working it keeps saying “Connecting”. I rarely write a review, but I want zoom to fix this as my company phone communications depend on this app since we recently switched from a VoIP provider to Zoom.
相关	IM SO MAD! I JUST TRIED TO SIGN UP AND I PUT IN THE WRONG BIRTH DATE SO IT WONT WORK! ALSO IM ON IPAD AND IT NEVER LETS ME SHARE SCREEN I USE TO LOVE THIS APP BUT NO 'broken_heart'
无关	Privacy issues, China linked, not trusted. Done.
无关	Cool service, but not at all effective in the midst of a global pandemic. Too many issues with connectivity, accessibility, and differences in availability with students and teachers alike.  
无关	Great app! Grateful for the technology!
无关	Tried to zoom in on Dolphins 50 feet away, didn\'t do a thing for me.  
相关	Hey Zoom! I found out today that anytime I open your iOS app, you share my data with Facebook via the Graph API. Data like when I open Zoom, my phone model, location, phone carrier, and more. The fact that you’re doing this is unethical, but that I didn’t know about it?!?! I’ve uninstalled. Shame on you.  
相关	Overall, zoom has been pretty good.  My only issues is glitchy video sand audio, but that might just be people spotty internet and not speaking clearly.  And the second issues, the bigger one, is when I’m on my phone I cant get rid of the top and bottom bars that have the buttons like mute, video, share video etc.  this means I cant see the full screen when my phone is on its side.  And its too small when my phone is standing up.
无关	it's one of my favorite apps
相关	It always says meeting links are invalid but they never are. They are active working links.
无关	Not exactly the same, but next best 'kiss_mark'
相关	zoom keeps lagging every time i have a meeting and the mic never seems to work so i would have to leave my class to relaunch the meeting! what a pain!
