# User_Contribution
This repository contains intermediate data and code for the paper **Estimating user contribution from user reviews and update logs**.

We propose a temporal-aware analysis approach to quantify user contribution during app evolution based on user reviews and update logs, which consists of three steps: review filtering, review log matching, and contribution mining analysis, and is trained and evaluated in RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, respectively.
